# Ray tracer

This ray tracer is written for the WebGL framework in glsl. If you want to take a look download the json files, go to https://shaderlabweb.doc.ic.ac.uk/ and upload the json files. I have put photos here too but shaderlab is interactive and its way cooler. 6a is basic geometric raytracing and in 6b I have added fog.
